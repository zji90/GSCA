Title: GSCA: Gene Set Context Analysis
Version: 2.0.0
Date: 2015-12-8
Author: Zhicheng Ji, Hongkai Ji
Maintainer: Zhicheng Ji <zji4@jhu.edu>
Description: GSCA takes as input several lists of activated and
        repressed genes. GSCA then searches through a compendium of
        publicly available gene expression profiles for biological
        contexts that are enriched with a specified pattern of gene
        expression. GSCA provides both traditional R functions and
        interactive, user-friendly user interface.
